Recipes is a simple app for storing your own recipes and sharing them using iCloud. There is no need to create an account in this app because it uses your iCloud account, allowing you to sync your recipes across all your devices and share them with friends.

Features:

* Create Recipes that sync across all of your devices via iCloud.
* Create Cookbooks and add your Recipes to them, then share your Cookbooks with friends via iCloud. Think of Cookbooks as iCloud PhotoStreams, but for recipes instead of photos.
